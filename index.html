            The global automotive industry is trying 
            to switch to alternative energy options 
            in a big way. India’s recent investments 
            too will see an exemplary shift in the near
            future. Indian EV Market value stood at USD
            5 billion in 2020, and it is predicted to 
            reach USD 47 billion by 2026. This is a CAGR
            of more than 44% during 2021-2026.

            The coming decade in India looks electric. 
            There is a lot to gain, both in terms of 
            energy conservation and economic growth, 
            with the adoption of electric vehicles. 
            As per a report by NITI Aayog, accelerated 
            adoption of electric vehicles can lead to 
            savings of $60 billion in petrol and diesel 
            costs. Most importantly, electric vehicles in 
            India have zero tailpipe emissions, are less noisy,
            and with a tank-to-wheel efficiency of approximately
            60-80%, they outperform your conventional cars considerably.

            According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA),
            the average home in the U.S. in 2021 was charged almost 
            $0.14 per kWh. Taking this number for our example, newer 
            EVs can hold up to 100 kWh. This means it would cost you 
            $14 to charge your EV to full capacity if you “fueled” up at home.

            Another way to consider how much you will likely pay to charge 
            your EV is by breaking it down by the mathematical statement: 
            The electricity cost per day is equal to the energy consumption, 
            “E”, in kWh per day multiplied by the energy cost of 1 kWh in 
            cents per kWh divided by 100 cents per dollar.
            
            Cost($/day) = E(kWh/day) × Cost(cent/kWh) / 100(cent/$).
